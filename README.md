# Node.js Asynchronous File Reading and JSON Parsing Errors

This example demonstrates a common error in Node.js: improper handling of asynchronous file reading and JSON parsing.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect handling of errors, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The original code fails to properly handle errors that may occur during file reading or JSON parsing.  If the file doesn't exist or is not valid JSON, the errors will be lost or not handled effectively.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution by including error handling within the callbacks of asynchronous operations.
